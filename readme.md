Hybrid AI-Powered Orchestrator

Goal: Combine AutoGen for high-level reasoning (task planning, validation) with LLM function calling for execution (code generation, review, testing, deployment).


---

1. Architecture Overview

1. AutoGen as the Orchestrator

Uses multiple AI agents to plan, reason, and validate workflows.

Ensures all steps are covered.



2. LLM Function Calling for Execution

Calls function-based AI agents for actual development tasks (code gen, review, testing, deployment).

Ensures tasks follow pre-defined standards.





---

2. Implementation Steps

1. AutoGen Planner Agent: Plans workflow steps.


2. AutoGen Validator Agent: Ensures each step is logically correct.


3. LLM Function Calls: Executes approved tasks (code generation, review, testing, deployment).

3. Implementation Code

Step 1: Install Dependencies

pip install pyautogen openai


---

Step 2: Define LLM Function Calling for Task Execution

Each function represents a specialized agent (e.g., code generation, review, testing, deployment).

import openai
import json

# Define available execution functions (LLM-based agents)
functions = [
    {
        "name": "code_generation_agent",
        "description": "Generate code based on user specifications",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "feature_description": {"type": "string", "description": "Feature requirements"}
            },
            "required": ["feature_description"],
        },
    },
    {
        "name": "code_review_agent",
        "description": "Review code and provide quality feedback",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "code": {"type": "string", "description": "Source code to review"}
            },
            "required": ["code"],
        },
    },
    {
        "name": "testing_agent",
        "description": "Run automated tests and return results",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "code": {"type": "string", "description": "Code to test"}
            },
            "required": ["code"],
        },
    },
    {
        "name": "deployment_agent",
        "description": "Deploy code to the production environment",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "artifact": {"type": "string", "description": "Built software artifact for deployment"}
            },
            "required": ["artifact"],
        },
    },
]

# Function to invoke LLM-based execution agents
def execute_task(task_name, arguments):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are an AI execution agent responsible for development tasks."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Execute task: {task_name} with arguments: {arguments}"}
        ],
        functions=functions
    )

    function_call = response["choices"][0]["message"].get("function_call")
    if function_call:
        function_name = function_call["name"]
        arguments = json.loads(function_call["arguments"])
        return f"Executed {function_name} with args {arguments}"
    
    return "Execution failed"

Step 3: Use AutoGen to Plan & Validate Execution

We use AutoGen Agents to:

1. Plan the workflow.


2. Validate execution at each stage.


3. Decide if tasks need to be re-executed.



from autogen import UserProxyAgent, AssistantAgent

# Define AI Agents
planner = AssistantAgent("Planner", llm_config={"model": "gpt-4-turbo"})
validator = AssistantAgent("Validator", llm_config={"model": "gpt-4-turbo"})
developer = AssistantAgent("Developer", llm_config={"model": "gpt-4-turbo"})

# Define Workflow Logic
def ai_orchestrator(feature_request):
    print("\nüöÄ AI Planner is creating a workflow...\n")
    
    # Planner Agent: Breaks down development tasks
    workflow = planner.generate_reply(
        "Break the following request into a development workflow ensuring all steps are included: "
        + feature_request
    )

    print(f"\n‚úÖ Planned Workflow: {workflow}\n")
    
    # Validator Agent: Ensures workflow correctness
    validation = validator.generate_reply(
        "Validate if this workflow covers all necessary steps and follows best practices: " + workflow
    )
    
    if "error" in validation.lower():
        print("\n‚ùå Validation Failed: Refining workflow...\n")
        return ai_orchestrator(feature_request)
    
    print("\n‚úÖ Workflow validated. Executing tasks...\n")

    # Execute each step using LLM function calling
    for task in ["code_generation_agent", "code_review_agent", "testing_agent", "deployment_agent"]:
        print(f"\nüîÑ Executing {task}...\n")
        result = execute_task(task, {"feature_description": feature_request})
        
        # Validate execution
        validation = validator.generate_reply(f"Is the output of {task} valid? {result}")
        
        if "error" in validation.lower():
            print(f"\n‚ùå {task} failed. Re-running...\n")
            return ai_orchestrator(feature_request)

        print(f"\n‚úÖ {task} successful: {result}\n")
    
    print("\nüéâ Software development and deployment completed successfully!")
    return "Success"

# Run AI-Orchestrated Development
ai_orchestrator("Build an API for user authentication.")

4. How This Works

5. Why This Hybrid Approach?

‚úÖ Scalability ‚Äì AutoGen handles complex reasoning, while LLM function calls execute tasks efficiently.
‚úÖ Flexibility ‚Äì AutoGen agents discuss and adjust workflows dynamically.
‚úÖ Strict Validation ‚Äì Execution steps are checked before moving forward.
‚úÖ Reusability ‚Äì Each LLM-based execution function can be reused for different workflows.
